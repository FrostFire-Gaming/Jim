There once was a man named Jim,
Who wanted to learn how to swim.
So he went to the pool,
Looking MIGHTY cool,
With his floaties and his spongebob trunks.

When he got in the pool
he did not look cool
as he splashed all about
he started to pout
all the people laughed, they were quite cruel.

And though he was sad,
He didn't get mad,
Because he knew in his heart,
That swimming was mostly an art,
And one day he would be rad.
