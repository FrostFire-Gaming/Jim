There once was a man named Jim,
Who wanted to learn how to swim.
So he went to the pool,
Looking MIGHTY cool,
With his floaties and his spongebob trunks.

When he got in the pool
he did not look cool
as he splished and splashed all about
he began to pout
all the people laughed, they were quite cruel.
