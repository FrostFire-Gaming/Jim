There once was a man named Jim,
Who wanted to learn how to swim.
So he went to the pool,
Looking SUPER cool,
With his floaties and his spandex onsie.

When he got in the pool,
He did not look cool.
As he splashed all about,
He started to pout.
All the people laughed, they were quite cruel.

I MADE MY CHANGE FIRST DENNIS
He didn't get mad,
Because he knew in his heart,
That swimming was mostly an art,
And one day he would be rad.
